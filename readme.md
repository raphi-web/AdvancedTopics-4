# Advanced-Topics-4

This repository contains the code and data for advanced topics 4 of Geoinformatics course, TU-Graz. The Notebook is also available as a colab [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PLYsNaQGpnnBI5XW7RGacs0qThh4Y_oF?usp=sharing).

The submitted document was created within the course Selected Topics of Geo-information Science. It covers assignment number 4 from the summer semester 2023. In it, the maximal covering location problem (MCLP) was utilized to investigate the service and demands for hospitals in Styria. In particular, the service radius r of hospitals and how it relates to the number of people served in the area. For this, the municipalities of Styria have been simplified to geometric centroids with the respective population as an attribute. And the service area is assumed to be a circle with radius $r$, that has its center in the hospital location.

Within the Assignment 3 tasks have been given:

1. Find the minimum service radius with which a total coverage is possible.
2. Find a position for an additional hospital that would significantly decrease the minimum
needed service radius.
3. Is a buffer around the hospitals the best way to describe their service area? Are other
approaches more suitable?
